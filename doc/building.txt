## Prerequisites ##

JTAG Knocker requires very few items in order to build. These are:
- A functioning arm compiler.
  By default arm-none-eabi-gcc is assumed (available as a Ubuntu package from: https://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/gcc-arm-embedded

- A STM32 Discovery development board.
  Currently only the STM32F3 board has been tested, it should work on others as long as the correct processor is set.

- stlink or a way to program the development board. Available from https://github.com/texane/stlink


## Building ##

A `make all` should in most cases suffice, generating a elf file in the source directory.

For more advanced usage, the following make targets are available:

- `jtagknocker`

   Build the source and generates a elf file for loading into the STM32F3 
   discovery board. This is the default target.

- `test`

   Builds the test code. An elf file is left in the test directort that can be
   loaded into the STM32F3 and output monitored on the serial pins.

- `clean`

   Standard cleanup target.

- `docs`

   Generates documentation for usage and the source code.

The Makefile takes several variables when compiling to aid support for other
targets. These are:

- `PREFIX`

   Sets the cross compiler prefix. If not specified it defaults to `arm-none-eabi`

- `DEVICE`

   Sets the target device for libopencm3. It defaults to `stm32f303vct6` which
   is the processor on the STM32F3 Discovery board.
