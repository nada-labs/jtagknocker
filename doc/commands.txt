@page commands Protocol and Commands
@section proto Protocol Specification

Commands and Replies are line based, terminated by CRLF and space delimited. 
Commands can also be terminated by a single LF. Commands are issued at a 
prompt '>' and once a command is executed a success 'OK' or error 'ERROR' 
reply will be given, to indicate the status of that command. Additional 
information may be provided by a command to indicate results or more error 
information, but this will be at a message level of GENERAL (1) or greater.

@subsection protoex Protocol Example

    > help
    Valid Commands: 
     help scan chain config clock tap message shift tdi tdo tck tms trst srst
    OK
    > 

The `help` command was issued at the prompt and it responded with the list of
valid commands. As the command completed successfully, it responded with OK
and a new prompt was issued.

    > confg
    Invalid command
    ERROR
    > 

In this case a command was mispelled and as it didn't execute correctly, an
error response was returned, followed by another prompt.

@section cmds Command List
 The folling commands are valid:
  help
	Displays this list of valid commands.

  scan npins [reset|bypass]
	Scans for a JTAG interface on pins 1 - npins
	  reset mode uses a TAP Reset to look for idcodes, this mode will fail
	  if no devices on the chain support IDCODE. Takes 
	  (npins*(npins-1)+(npins-2) operations.
			
	  bypass mode scans BYPASS commands into the TAPs and looks for TDO. 
	  Takes (npins*(npins-1)*(npins-2) operations.

	If the mode is not specified, the scan defaults to reset.
	All pins are left deconfigured when the scan finishes.

  chain	
	Once a valid interface has been configured, scans the chain and 
	determines the properities of the devices. It attempts to find the 
	number of devices on the chain and their IDCODE(s).

  config [tck|tms|tdi|tdo|trst|srst|rtck [pin]]
	Displays the pin number the signal is configured to, assigning if pin
	is provided.
	The config command by itself will return the current pin assignments
	for all signals, which by default is:
	  Signal	Pin
	  TCK		1
	  TMS		2
	  TDI		3
	  TDO		4
	Specifing a pin of 0 deconfigures the signal.
  
  config clock [rate|adaptive]
	Displays the JTAG clock speed, setting it to rate if provided.
	rate is in kHz.
	Adaptive clocking is only valid when the rclk signal has been 
	assigned and waits for the TAP to acknowledge the clock transition
	before moving on.

  clock n
	Toggle the clock line n times.

  tck|tms|tdi|tdo|trst|srst|rtck [state]
	The current state of the requested signal is to state, if provided, 
	and displayed. Setting is only valid for outputs (not tdo or rclk).
	  A state of 1 is logic high, A state of 0 is logic low.

  tap [reset|run_idle|shift_dr|pause_dr|shift_ir|pause_ir]
	Displays the current state of the TAP controller, and sets it to the
	provided state. 
	TRST will be used to move to the reset state, if configured, otherwise
	a TAP state walk will be used.

  message level
	Sets the message level. 
	3 for all messages, 0 for required messages only, default level is 1.

  shift
	Enters data shift mode. The prompt will change to >> and hex 
	encoded data should be provided. Data read in from TDO will be 
	returned.

	This mode will exit when a invalid character (not 0-9a-fA-F) is 
	received. The data is send in little endian nibbles and should be 
	pre-padded to bring the total size to a multiple of 4.

	Example:
	  >tap shift_ir
	  RESET -> SHIFT_IR
	  >shift
	  >>(810)100
	  >tap shift_dr
	  SHIFT_IR -> SHIFT_DR
	  >shift
	  >>(00000000)DD02B020
	  >

	  This shifts in an IDCODE command (006) zero padded by 2 bits into
	  the instruction register and the contents captured from CAPTURE_IR
	  is returned. The idcode is then shifted out, which when nibble 
	  reversed is 0x020B20DD, an Altera EP2C8. The data in brackets above
	  is sent by the user but not displayed.
